# About the project

 - Simple Microservice architecture with docker(MSSQL, .Net Core Api, razor frontend)
 - Tests with Autofixture, Xunit (razor pages), Nunit (Api), Cypress (integration test)
 
## Start instructions

Just start the solution with the docker compose project as startup. 

## !note! 
- The browser will show a no socket error upon startup. Just refresh the browser after a short while and you will see the application. 
- This error appears since the DB is slow to start, I havenÂ´t figured out how to solve this quite yet.
