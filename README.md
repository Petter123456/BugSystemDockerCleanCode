# BugSystemDockerCleanCode

## Start instructions

Just start the solution with the docker compose project as startup. 

##!note! 
- The browser will show a no socket error upon startup. Just refresh the browser after a short while and you will se the application. 
- This error appears since de DB is slow to start, I havenÂ´t figured out how to solve this quite yet.
